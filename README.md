# Java OOP - Lab Activity in School
Hello, World! I wanted to document and put these lab activities in my github repo as I learned Java language which is used in my OOP subject for second year at my University.

### 1. [Lab Activity 1](lab_act_files/Lab1.java) 
 
   - I learned here how to make `variables` and `methods` in class and how to initialize an object using `new` keyword.

### 2. [Lab Activity 2 - part 1 ](lab_act_files/Lab2.java) and [part 2](lab_act_files/Lab2_1.java) 
   - In this lab we use the `inheritance` using the `extends` keyword to have a subclass.

### 3. [Lab Activity 3 - part 1 ](lab_act_files/Lab3.java) and [part 2](lab_act_files/Lab3_1.java) 
- In this lab I learned how to use a `parameterized method` and a method that `returns` a value

### 4. [Lab Activity 4](lab_act_files/Lab4.java) 
- In this lab I learned how to use the `getter` and `setter` methods and the `private` access modifier to variables. We also used the `this` keyword and the `Scanner` class.

### 5. [Lab Activity 5](lab_act_files/Lab5.java) 
- In this lab we used `parameterized constructors` and `if-else` statements to print the whether the average is ood or even.
